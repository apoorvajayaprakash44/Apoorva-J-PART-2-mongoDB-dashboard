# Student Performance Analysis – MongoDB Dashboard
## This dashboard presents an exploratory analysis of student academic performance using data visualized through MongoDB Charts. The objective is to identify patterns, relationships, and demographic influences on student scores across math, reading, and writing.
## Insights
### Gender-wise Performance Analysis
Bar charts compare average math, reading, and writing scores across genders, highlighting subject-wise performance differences.

### Correlation Between Reading & Writing Scores
A scatter plot demonstrates a strong positive correlation between reading and writing scores, indicating that students who perform well in reading tend to score similarly in writing.

### Overall Performance Indicators
Gauge charts display the mean math score and mean writing score, offering a quick snapshot of overall academic performance.

### Lunch Type Distribution
A donut chart shows the proportion of students receiving standard versus free/reduced lunch, providing socioeconomic context to the dataset.

### Subject-wise Average Scores by Gender
A detailed table summarizes mean scores in math, reading, and writing for each gender, allowing easy comparison across subjects.

### Cultural & Ethnic Influence on Test Preparation
Line and donut charts visualize student distribution across race/ethnicity groups and their participation in test preparation courses.

### Parental Education Impact
A grouped bar chart analyzes how parental education levels influence students’ writing performance, suggesting a positive association between higher parental education and higher scores.
